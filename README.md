# WPget
## A lightweight Wordpress downloader
Sometimes you might not want to download the Wordpress installer then re-upload it on your server. Here comes the WPget script.
Just upload this script to your server and go to the install location. Choose your language and installation path.
Once the script has been executed, it will delete itself for obvious security reasons.
